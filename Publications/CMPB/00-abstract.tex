We present \gls*{mbis}, a clustering tool based on
  the mixture of multivariate normal distributions model.
\Gls*{mbis} supports multichannel bias field correction
  based on a B-spline model.
A second methodological novelty is the inclusion of
  \acrlong*{graph_cuts} optimization for the stationary
  anisotropic \acrlong*{markov} model.
Along with \gls*{mbis}, we release an evaluation framework that
  contains three different experiments on multi-site data.
We first validate the accuracy of segmentation and the estimated
  bias field for each channel.
\Gls*{mbis} outperforms a widely used segmentation tool in a
  cross-comparison evaluation.
The second experiment demonstrates the robustness of results
  on atlas-free segmentation of two image sets from scan-rescan
  protocols on 21 healthy subjects.
Multivariate segmentation is more replicable than the monospectral
  counterpart on \acrlong*{t1} images.
Finally, we provide a third experiment to illustrate how \gls*{mbis}
  can be used in a large-scale study of tissue volume change with
  increasing age in 584 healthy subjects.
This last result is meaningful as multivariate segmentation performs
  robustly without the need for prior knowledge.
