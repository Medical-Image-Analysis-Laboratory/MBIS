	abstract = {We compare three widely used brain volumetry methods available in the software packages {FSL}, {SPM5}, and {FreeSurfer} and evaluate their performance using simulated and real {MR} brain data sets. We analyze the accuracy of gray and white matter volume measurements and their robustness against changes of image quality using the {BrainWeb} {MRI} database. These images are based on "gold-standard" reference brain templates. This allows us to assess between- (same data set, different method) and also within-segmenter (same method, variation of image quality) comparability, for both of which we find pronounced variations in segmentation results for gray and white matter volumes. The calculated volumes deviate up to {\textgreater}10\% from the reference values for gray and white matter depending on method and image quality. Sensitivity is best for {SPM5}, volumetric accuracy for gray and white matter was similar in {SPM5} and {FSL} and better than in {FreeSurfer.} {FSL} showed the highest stability for white ({\textless}5\%), {FreeSurfer} (6.2\%) for gray matter for constant image quality {BrainWeb} data. Between-segmenter comparisons show discrepancies of up to {\textgreater}20\% for the simulated data and 24\% on average for the real data sets, whereas within-method performance analysis uncovered volume differences of up to {\textgreater}15\%. Since the discrepancies between results reach the same order of magnitude as volume changes observed in disease, these effects limit the usability of the segmentation methods for following volume changes in individual patients over time and should be taken into account during the planning and analysis of brain volume studies.},

	abstract = {An integrated approach for multi-spectral segmentation of {MR} images is presented. This method is based on the fuzzy c-means ({FCM)} and includes bias field correction and contextual constraints over spatial intensity distribution and accounts for the non-spherical cluster's shape in the feature space. The bias field is modeled as a linear combination of smooth polynomial basis functions for fast computation in the clustering iterations. Regularization terms for the neighborhood continuity of intensity are added into the {FCM} cost functions. To reduce the computational complexity, the contextual regularizations are separated from the clustering iterations. Since the feature space is not isotropic, distance measure adopted in {Gustafson{\textendash}Kessel} ({G{\textendash}K)} algorithm is used instead of the Euclidean distance, to account for the non-spherical shape of the clusters in the feature space. These algorithms are quantitatively evaluated on {MR} brain images using the similarity measures.},

	title = {Fast, Approximately Optimal Solutions for Single and Dynamic {MRFs}},
	doi = {10.1109/CVPR.2007.383095},
	abstract = {A new efficient {MRF} optimization algorithm, called Fast-{PD}, is proposed, which generalizes a-expansion. One of its main advantages is that it offers a substantial speedup over that method, e.g. it can be at least 3-9 times faster than a-expansion. Its efficiency is a result of the fact that Fast-{PD} exploits information coming not only from the original {MRF} problem, but also from a dual problem. Furthermore, besides static {MRFs}, it can also be used for boosting the performance of dynamic {MRFs}, i.e. {MRFs} varying over time. On top of that, Fast-{PD} makes no compromise about the optimality of its solutions: it can compute exactly the same answer as a-expansion, but, unlike that method, it can also guarantee an almost optimal solution for a much wider class of {NP-hard} {MRF} problems. Results on static and dynamic {MRFs} demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency and power. E.g., Fast-{PD} has been able to compute disparity for stereoscopic sequences in real time, with the resulting disparity coinciding with that of a-expansion.},

	abstract = {The large spatial inhomogeneity in transmit B1 field (B1+) observable in human {MR} images at high static magnetic fields (B0) severely impairs image quality. To overcome this effect in brain {{T1}}-weighted images, the {MPRAGE} sequence was modified to generate two different images at different inversion times, {MP2RAGE.} By combining the two images in a novel fashion, it was possible to create {{T1}}-weigthed images where the result image was free of proton density contrast, T2? contrast, reception bias field, and, to first order, transmit field inhomogeneity.

{MP2RAGE} sequence parameters were optimized using Bloch equations to maximize contrast-to-noise ratio per unit of time between brain tissues and minimize the effect of B1+ variations through space. Images of high anatomical quality and excellent brain tissue differentiation suitable for applications such as segmentation and voxel-based morphometry were obtained at 3 and 7 T.

From such {{T1}}-weighted images, acquired within 12 min, high-resolution {3D} {{T1}} maps were routinely calculated at 7 T with sub-millimeter voxel resolution (0.65{\textendash}0.85~mm isotropic). {{T1}} maps were validated in phantom experiments. In humans, the {T1} values obtained at 7 T were 1.15\&\#xa0;{\textpm}\&\#xa0;0.06 s for white matter ({WM)} and 1.92\&\#xa0;{\textpm}\&\#xa0;0.16 s for grey matter ({GM)}, in good agreement with literature values obtained at lower spatial resolution. At 3 T, where whole-brain acquisitions with 1~mm isotropic voxels were acquired in 8 min, the {T1} values obtained (0.81\&\#xa0;{\textpm}\&\#xa0;0.03 s for {WM} and 1.35\&\#xa0;{\textpm}\&\#xa0;0.05 for {GM)} were once again found to be in very good agreement with values in the literature.},

	abstract = {Linear registration and motion correction are important components of structural and functional brain image analysis. Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid global{\textendash}local optimization method. This new optimization method is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods.},

The method, Brain Extraction Tool ({BET)}, uses a deformable model that evolves to fit the brain's surface by the application of a set of locally adaptive model forces. The method is very fast and requires no preregistration or other pre-processing before being applied. We describe the new method and give examples of results and the results of extensive quantitative testing against "gold-standard" hand segmentations, and two other popular automated methods.},

	abstract = {Objectives Brain segmentation and volume estimation of grey matter ({GM)}, white matter ({WM)} and cerebro-spinal fluid ({CSF)} are important for many neurological applications. Volumetric changes are observed in multiple sclerosis ({MS)}, {Alzheimer}{\textquoteright}s disease and dementia, and in normal aging. A novel method is presented to segment brain tissue based on quantitative magnetic resonance imaging ({qMRI)} of the longitudinal relaxation rate R 1 , the transverse relaxation rate R 2 and the proton density, {PD.} Methods Previously reported {qMRI} values for {WM}, {GM} and {CSF} were used to define tissues and a Bloch simulation performed to investigate R 1 , R 2 and {PD} for tissue mixtures in the presence of noise. Based on the simulations a lookup grid was constructed to relate tissue partial volume to the R 1 {{\textendash}R} 2 {{\textendash}PD} space. The method was validated in 10 healthy subjects. {MRI} data were acquired using six resolutions and three geometries. Results Repeatability for different resolutions was 3.2\% for {WM}, 3.2\% for {GM}, 1.0\% for {CSF} and 2.2\% for total brain volume. Repeatability for different geometries was 8.5\% for {WM}, 9.4\% for {GM}, 2.4\% for {CSF} and 2.4\% for total brain volume. Conclusion We propose a new robust {qMRI-based} approach which we demonstrate in a patient with {MS.} Key Points {\textbullet} A method for segmenting the brain and estimating tissue volume is presented {\textbullet} This method measures white matter, grey matter, cerebrospinal fluid and remaining tissue {\textbullet} The method calculates tissue fractions in voxel, thus accounting for partial volume {\textbullet} Repeatability was 2.2\% for total brain volume with imaging resolution \&lt;2.0 mm},

The models assume either Gaussian system sampling noise or intrinsic material variances with Gaussian or Poisson statistics. In particular, a material can be viewed as having a distinct value that has been corrupted by additive noise either before or after partial volume mixing, or the material could have nondistinct values with a Poisson distribution as might be the case in nuclear medicine images. General forms of the probability density functions are presented for the N material cases and particular forms for two- and three-material cases are derived. These models are incorporated into finite mixture densities in order to more accurately model the distribution of image pixel values. Examples are presented using simulated histograms to demonstrate the efficacy of the models for quantification. Modeling of partial volume effect is shown to be useful when one of the materials is present in images mainly as a pixel component},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a new rigorous theoretical framework to address discrete {MRF-based} optimization in computer vision. Such a framework exploits the powerful technique of Dual Decomposition. It is based on a projected subgradient scheme that attempts to solve an {MRF} optimization problem by first decomposing it into a set of appropriately chosen subproblems, and then combining their solutions in a principled way. In order to determine the limits of this method, we analyze the conditions that these subproblems have to satisfy and demonstrate the extreme generality and flexibility of such an approach. We thus show that by appropriately choosing what subproblems to use, one can design novel and very powerful {MRF} optimization algorithms. For instance, in this manner we are able to derive algorithms that: 1) generalize and extend state-of-the-art message-passing methods, 2) optimize very tight {LP-relaxations} to {MRF} optimization, and 3) take full advantage of the special structure that may exist in particular {MRFs}, allowing the use of efficient inference techniques such as, e.g., graph-cut-based methods. Theoretical analysis on the bounds related with the different algorithms derived from our framework and experimental results/comparisons using synthetic and real data for a variety of tasks in computer vision demonstrate the extreme potentials of our approach.},

Global grey matter volume decreased linearly with age, with a significantly steeper decline in males. Local areas of accelerated loss were observed bilaterally in the insula, superior parietal gyri, central sulci, and cingulate sulci. Areas exhibiting little or no age effect (relative preservation) were noted in the amygdala, hippocampi, and entorhinal cortex. Global white matter did not decline with age, but local areas of relative accelerated loss and preservation were seen. There was no interaction of age with sex for regionally specific effects.

The algorithm is based on information from {T1}-weighted ({T1}-w), inversion recovery ({IR)}, proton density-weighted ({PD)}, T2-weighted (T2-w) and fluid attenuation inversion recovery ({FLAIR)} scans. It uses the K-Nearest Neighbor classification technique that builds a feature space from spatial information and voxel intensities. The technique generates for each tissue type an image representing the probability per voxel being part of it. By application of thresholds on these probability maps, binary segmentations can be obtained. A similarity index ({SI)} and a probabilistic {SI} ({PSI)} were calculated for quantitative evaluation of the results. The influence of each image type on the performance was investigated by alternately leaving out one of the five scan types. This procedure showed that the incorporation of the {T1}-w, {PD} or T2-w did not significantly improve the segmentation results. Further investigation indicated that the combination of {IR} and {FLAIR} was optimal for segmentation of the five brain tissue types. Evaluation with respect to the gold standard showed that the {SI-values} for all tissues exceeded 0.8 and all {PSI-values} exceeded 0.7, implying an excellent agreement.},

We present a method for segmentation of brain tissue from magnetic resonance images that is a combination of three existing techniques from the computer vision literature: expectation/maximization segmentation, binary mathematical morphology, and active contour models. Each of these techniques has been customized for the problem of brain tissue segmentation such that the resultant method is more robust than its components. Finally, we present the results of a parallel implementation of this method on {IBM's} supercomputer Power Visualization System for a database of 20 brain scans each with 256 {\texttimes} 256 {\texttimes} 124 voxels and validate those results against segmentations generated by neuroanatomy experts.},

Our objective was to develop and evaluate a fully automated method to estimate cerebral volume from magnetic resonance images ({MRI)} of patients with multiple sclerosis ({MS).} In this study, {MRI} data from 17 normal subjects and 68 untreated {MS} patients was used to test the method. Each {MRI} volume was corrected for image intensity non-uniformity, intensity normalized, brain masked and tissue classified. The classification results were used to compute a normalized metric of cerebral volume based on the Brain to {IntraCranial} Capacity Ratio ({BICCR).} This paper shows that the computation of {BICCR} using automated techniques provides a highly reproducible measurement of relative brain tissue volume that eliminates the need for precise repositioning. Initial results indicate that the measure is both robust and precise enough to monitor {MS} patients over time to estimate brain atrophy. In addition, brain atrophy may yield a more sensitive endpoint for treatment trials in {MS} and possibly for other neuro-degenerative diseases such as Huntington{\textquoteright}s or {Alzheimer}{\textquoteright}s disease.},

	abstract = {Background~
Adolescence provides a window to examine regional and disease-specific late abnormal brain development in schizophrenia. Because previous data showed progressive brain ventricular enlargement for a group of adolescents with childhood-onset schizophrenia at 2-year follow-up, with no significant changes for healthy controls, we hypothesized that there would be a progressive decrease in volume in other brain tissue in these patients during {adolescence.Methods}
To examine cortical change, we used anatomical brain magnetic resonance imaging scans for 15 patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia (defined as onset of psychosis by age 12 years) and 34 temporally yoked, healthy adolescents at a mean ({SD)} age of 13.17 (2.73) years at initial baseline scan and 17.46 (2.96) years at follow-up scan. Cortical gray and white matter volumes were obtained with an automated analysis system that classifies brain tissue into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid and separates the cortex into anatomically defined lobar {regions.Results}
A significant decrease in cortical gray matter volume was seen for healthy controls in the frontal (2.6\%) and parietal (4.1\%) regions. For the childhood-onset schizophrenia group, there was a decrease in volume in these regions (10.9\% and 8.5\%, respectively) as well as a 7\% decrease in volume in the temporal gray matter. Thus, the childhood-onset schizophrenia group showed a distinctive disease-specific pattern (multivariate analysis of variance for change{\texttimes}region{\texttimes}diagnosis: F, 3.68; P=.004), with the frontal and temporal regions showing the greatest between-group differences. Changes in white matter volume did not differ significantly between the 2 {groups.Conclusions}
Patients with very early-onset schizophrenia had both a 4-fold greater decrease in cortical gray matter volume during adolescence and a disease-specific pattern of change. Etiologic models for these patients' illness, which seem clinically and neurobiologically continuous with later-onset schizophrenia, must take into account both early and late disruptions of brain development.},

Inevitably, the role of quantitative image analysis in the evaluation of drug therapy will increase, driven in part by requirements imposed by regulatory agencies. However, the prohibitive length of time involved and the significant intra- and inter-rater variability of the measurements obtained from manual analysis of large {MRI} databases represent major obstacles to the wider application of quantitative {MRI} analysis. We have developed a fully automatic "pipeline" image analysis framework and have successfully applied it to a number of large-scale, multi-center studies (more than 1000 {MRI} scans). This pipeline system is based on robust image processing algorithms, executed in a parallel, distributed fashion. This paper describes the application of this system to the automatic quantification of multiple sclerosis lesion load in {MRI}, in the context of a phase {III} clinical trial. The pipeline results were evaluated through an extensive validation study, revealing that the obtained lesion measurements are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained by trained human observers. Given that intra- and inter-rater measurement variability is eliminated by automatic analysis, this system enhances the ability to detect small treatment effects not readily detectable through conventional analysis techniques. While useful for clinical trial analysis in multiple sclerosis, this system holds widespread potential for applications in other neurological disorders, as well as for the study of neurobiology in general.},

	abstract = {Accurate and automated methods for measuring the thickness of human cerebral cortex could provide powerful tools for diagnosing and studying a variety of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Manual methods for estimating cortical thickness from neuroimaging data are labor intensive, requiring several days of effort by a trained anatomist. Furthermore, the highly folded nature of the cortex is problematic for manual techniques, frequently resulting in measurement errors in regions in which the cortical surface is not perpendicular to any of the cardinal axes. As a consequence, it has been impractical to obtain accurate thickness estimates for the entire cortex in individual subjects, or group statistics for patient or control populations. Here, we present an automated method for accurately measuring the thickness of the cerebral cortex across the entire brain and for generating cross-subject statistics in a coordinate system based on cortical anatomy. The intersubject standard deviation of the thickness measures is shown to be less than 0.5 mm, implying the ability to detect focal atrophy in small populations or even individual subjects. The reliability and accuracy of this new method are assessed by within-subject test{\textendash}retest studies, as well as by comparison of cross-subject regional thickness measures with published values.},

	abstract = {We present a novel, computerized method of examining cerebral cortical thickness. The normal cortex varies in thickness from 2 to 4 mm, reflecting the morphology of neuronal sublayers. Cortical pathologies often manifest abnormal variations in thickness, with examples of {Alzheimer}'s disease and cortical dysplasia as thin and thick cortex, respectively. Radiologically, images are 2-D slices through a highly convoluted 3-D object. Depending on the relative orientation of the slices with respect to the object, it is impossible to deduce abnormal cortical thickness without additional information from neighboring slices. We approach the problem by applying {Laplace}'s Equation (?2$\psi$ = 0) from mathematical physics. The volume of the cortex is represented as the domain for the solution of the differential equation, with separate boundary conditions at the gray-white junction and the gray-{CSF} junction. Normalized gradients of $\psi$ form a vector field, representing tangent vectors along field lines connecting both boundaries. We define the cortical thickness at any point in the cortex to be the pathlength along such lines. Key advantages of this method are that it is fully three-dimensional, and the thickness is uniquely defined for any point in the cortex. We present graphical results that map cortical thickness everywhere in a normal brain. Results show global variations in cortical thickness consistent with known neuroanatomy. The application of this technique to visualization of cortical thickness in brains with known pathology has broad clinical implications. Hum.

	abstract = {Automatic computer processing of large multidimensional images such as those produced by magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} is greatly aided by deformable models, which are used to extract, identify, and quantify specific neuroanatomic structures. A general method of deforming polyhedra is presented here, with two novel features. First, explicit prevention of self-intersecting surface geometries is provided, unlike conventional deformable models, which use regularization constraints to discourage but not necessarily prevent such behavior. Second, deformation of multiple surfaces with intersurface proximity constraints allows each surface to help guide other surfaces into place using model-based constraints such as expected thickness of an anatomic surface. These two features are used advantageously to identify automatically the total surface of the outer and inner boundaries of cerebral cortical gray matter from normal human {MR} images, accurately locating the depths of the sulci, even where noise and partial volume artifacts in the image obscure the visibility of sulci. The extracted surfaces are enforced to be simple two-dimensional manifolds (having the topology of a sphere), even though the data may have topological holes. This automatic 3-D cortex segmentation technique has been applied to 150 normal subjects, simultaneously extracting both the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid interface from each individual. The collection of surfaces has been used to create a spatial map of the mean and standard deviation for the location and the thickness of cortical gray matter. Three alternative criteria for defining cortical thickness at each cortical location were developed and compared. These results are shown to corroborate published postmortem and in vivo measurements of cortical thickness.},

	abstract = {We describe a novel technique for characterizing regional cerebral gray and white matter differences in structural magnetic resonance images by the application of methods derived from functional imaging. The technique involves automatic scalp-editing of images followed by segmentation, smoothing, and spatial normalization to a symmetrical template brain in stereotactic Talairach space. The basic idea is (i) to convert structural magnetic resonance image data into spatially normalized images of gray (or white) matter density, effected by segmenting the images and smoothing, and then (ii) to use Statistical Parametric Mapping to make inferences about the relationship between gray (or white) matter density and symptoms (or other pathophysiological measures) in a regionally specific fashion. Because the whole brain sum of gray (or white) matter indices is treated as a confound, the analysis reduces to a characterization of relative gray (or white) matter density on a voxel by voxel basis. We suggest that this is a powerful approach to voxel-based statistical anatomy. Using the technique, we constructed maps of the regional cerebral gray and white matter density correlates of syndrome scores (distinct psychotic symptoms) in a group of 15 schizophrenic patients. There was a negative correlation between the score for the reality distortion syndrome and regional gray matter density in the left superior temporal lobe (P = 0.01) and regional white matter density in the corpus callosum (P \&lt; 0.001). These abnormalities may be associated with functional changes predisposing to auditory hallucinations and delusions. This method permits the detection of structural differences within the entire brain (as opposed to selected regions of interest) and may be of value in the investigation of structural gray and white matter abnormalities in a variety of brain diseases.},

The procedure is relatively straightforward and involves spatially normalizing high-resolution images from all the subjects in the study into the same stereotactic space. This is followed by segmenting the gray matter from the spatially normalized images and smoothing the gray-matter segments. Voxel-wise parametric statistical tests which compare the smoothed gray-matter images from the two groups are performed. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made using the theory of Gaussian random fields. This paper describes the steps involved in {VBM}, with particular emphasis on segmenting gray matter from {MR} images with nonuniformity artifact.

Specifically, the statistics of the resulting voxelwise comparisons are uninformative about group differences wherever the spatial normalization algorithm has failed to register on any robustly appearing image gradient.

In this commentary we describe why voxel-based statistics, which are commonly used to construct statistical parametric maps, are very limited in characterizing morphological differences between groups, and why the effectiveness of voxel-based statistics is significantly biased toward group differences that are highly localized in space and of linear nature, whereas it is significantly reduced in cases with group differences of similar or even higher magnitude, when these differences are spatially complex and subtle. The complex and often subtle and nonlinear ways in which various factors, such as age, sex, genotype and disease, can affect brain morphology, suggest that alternative, unbiased methods based on statistical learning theory might be able to better quantify brain changes that are due to a variety of factors, especially when relationships between brain networks, rather than individual structures, and disease are examined.},

	abstract = {Nonrigid registration ({NRR)} is routinely used in the study of neuroanatomy and function and is a standard component of analysis packages such as {SPM.} There remain many unresolved correspondence problems that arise from attempts to associate functional areas with specific neuroanatomy and to compare both function and anatomy across patient groups. Problems can result from ignorance of the underlying neurology which is then compounded by unjustified inferences drawn from the results of {NRR.} Usually the magnitude, distribution, and significance of errors in {NRR} are unknown so the errors in correspondences determined by {NRR} are also unknown and their effect on experimental results cannot easily be quantified. In this paper we review the principles by which the presumed correspondence and homology of structures is used to drive registration and identify the conceptual and algorithmic areas where current techniques are lacking. We suggest that for applications using {NRR} to be robust and achieve their potential, context-specific definitions of correspondence must be developed which properly characterise error. Prior knowledge of image content must be utilised to monitor and guide registration and gauge the degree of success. The use of {NRR} in voxel-based morphometry is examined from this context and found wanting. We conclude that a move away from increasingly sophisticated but context-free registration technology is required and that the veracity of studies that rely on {NRR} should be keenly questioned when the error distribution is unknown and the results are unsupported by other contextual information.},

	abstract = {Accurate quantification of small structures in magnetic resonance ({MR)} images is often limited by partial volume ({PV)} effects which arise when more than one tissue type is present in a voxel. {PV} may be critical when dealing with changes in brain anatomy as the considered structures such as gray matter ({GM)} are of similar size as the {MR} spatial resolution. To overcome the limitations imposed by {PV} effects and achieve subvoxel accuracy different methods have been proposed. Here, we describe a method to compute {PV} by modeling the {MR} signal with a biexponential linear combination representing the contribution of at most two tissues in each voxel. In a first step, we estimated the parameters ({T1}, T2 and proton density) per tissue. Then, based on the bi-exponential formulation one can retrieve fractional contents by solving a linear system of two equations with two unknowns, namely tissue magnetizations. Preliminary tests were conducted on images acquired on a specially designed physical phantom for the study of {PV} effects. Further, the model was tested on {BrainWeb} simulated brain images to estimate {GM} and white matter ({WM)} {PV} effects. Root mean squared error was computed between the {BrainWeb} ground truth and the obtained {GM} and {WM} {PV} maps. The proposed method outperformed traditionally used methods by 33\% and 34\% in {GM} and {WM}, respectively.},

	abstract = {This work presents an iterative expectation-maximization ({EM)} approach to the maximum a posteriori ({MAP)} solution of segmenting tissue mixtures inside each image voxel. Each tissue type is assumed to follow a normal distribution across the field-of-view ({FOV).} Furthermore, all tissue types are assumed to be independent from each other. Under these assumptions, the summation of all tissue mixtures inside each voxel leads to the image density mean value at that voxel. The summation of all the tissue mixtures' unobservable random processes leads to the observed image density at that voxel, and the observed image density value also follows a normal distribution (image data are observed to follow a normal distribution in many applications). By modeling the underlying tissue distributions as a Markov random field across the {FOV}, the conditional expectation of the posteriori distribution of the tissue mixtures inside each voxel is determined, given the observed image data and the current-iteration estimation of the tissue mixtures. Estimation of the tissue mixtures at next iteration is computed by maximizing the conditional expectation. The iterative {EM} approach to a {MAP} solution is achieved by a finite number of iterations and reasonable initial estimate. This {MAP-EM} framework provides a theoretical solution to the partial volume effect, which has been a major cause of quantitative imprecision in medical image processing. Numerical analysis demonstrated its potential to estimate tissue mixtures accurately and efficiently.},

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field ({MRF)} equivalence, this assignment also determines an {MRF} image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the {MRF.} For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an {MRF} with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states ({\textquotedblleft}annealing{\textquotedblright}), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori ({MAP)} estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel {\textquotedblleft}relaxation{\textquotedblright} algorithm for {MAP} estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

	abstract = {Due to the finite spatial resolution of imaging devices, a single voxel in a medical image may be composed of mixture of tissue types, an effect known as partial volume effect ({PVE).} Partial volume estimation, that is, the estimation of the amount of each tissue type within each voxel, has received considerable interest in recent years. Much of this work has been focused on the mixel model, a statistical model of {PVE.} We propose a novel trimmed minimum covariance determinant ({TMCD)} method for the estimation of the parameters of the mixel {PVE} model. In this method, each voxel is first labeled according to the most dominant tissue type. Voxels that are prone to {PVE} are removed from this labeled set, following which robust location estimators with high breakdown points are used to estimate the mean and the covariance of each tissue class. Comparisons between different methods for parameter estimation based on classified images as well as expectation{\textendash}maximization-like ({EM-like)} procedure for simultaneous parameter and partial volume estimation are reported. The robust estimators based on a pruned classification as presented here are shown to perform well even if the initial classification is of poor quality. The results obtained are comparable to those obtained using the {EM-like} procedure, but require considerably less computation time. Segmentation results of real data based on partial volume estimation are also reported. In addition to considering the parameter estimation problem, we discuss differences between different approximations to the complete mixel model. In summary, the proposed {TMCD} method allows for the accurate, robust, and efficient estimation of partial volume model parameters, which is crucial to a variety of brain {MRI} data analysis procedures such as the accurate estimation of tissue volumes and the accurate delineation of the cortical surface.},

	abstract = {Conventional k-Nearest-Neighbor ({kNN)} classification, which has been successfully applied to classify brain tissue in {MR} data, requires training on manually labeled subjects. This manual labeling is a laborious and time-consuming procedure. In this work, a new fully automated brain tissue classification procedure is presented, in which {kNN} training is automated. This is achieved by non-rigidly registering the {MR} data with a tissue probability atlas to automatically select training samples, followed by a post-processing step to keep the most reliable samples. The accuracy of the new method was compared to rigid registration-based training and to conventional {kNN-based} segmentation using training on manually labeled subjects for segmenting gray matter ({GM)}, white matter ({WM)} and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} in 12 data sets. Furthermore, for all classification methods, the performance was assessed when varying the free parameters. Finally, the robustness of the fully automated procedure was evaluated on 59 subjects. The automated training method using non-rigid registration with a tissue probability atlas was significantly more accurate than rigid registration. For both automated training using non-rigid registration and for the manually trained {kNN} classifier, the difference with the manual labeling by observers was not significantly larger than inter-observer variability for all tissue types. From the robustness study, it was clear that, given an appropriate brain atlas and optimal parameters, our new fully automated, non-rigid registration-based method gives accurate and robust segmentation results. A similarity index was used for comparison with manually trained {kNN.} The similarity indices were 0.93, 0.92 and 0.92, for {CSF}, {GM} and {WM}, respectively. It can be concluded that our fully automated method using non-rigid registration may replace manual segmentation, and thus that automated brain tissue segmentation without laborious manual training is feasible.},

The neighborhood effect acts as a regularizer and biases the solution toward piecewise-homogeneous labelings. Such a regularization is useful in segmenting scans corrupted by salt and pepper noise.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} To compare brain tissue in patients with {Alzheimer} disease with that in elderly control subjects by using high-resolution {MR} imaging and quantitative tissue-segmentation techniques.
{METHODS} {MR} imaging of the brain was performed in 21 patients with {Alzheimer} disease and 17 control subjects. A computerized segmentation program was used to quantify volumes of ventricular and sulcal cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)}, white matter, cortical gray matter, and white matter signal hyperintensity. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance.
{RESULTS} We found a significant decrease in total brain tissue and cortical gray matter and an increase in the ventricular and sulcal {CSF} in {Alzheimer} patients compared with control subjects. There was no difference in the volume of white matter. More white matter signal hyperintensities were found in {Alzheimer} patients, and a significant interaction between age and group was noted. Neuropsychological test scores correlated significantly with sulcal {CSF} in patients with {Alzheimer} disease.
{CONCLUSION} Semiautomated segmentation of {MR} images of the brains of patients with {Alzheimer} disease reveals significant brain atrophy attributable to loss of cortical gray matter, which is compatible with the pathologic features of {Alzheimer} disease. There is also a significant increase in white matter signal hyperintensities. Tissue segmentation may increase our understanding of dementia but, as yet, when used alone, it does not play a role in the premorbid diagnosis of {Alzheimer} disease.},

	abstract = {Background
A number of studies have found brain enlargement in autism, but there is disagreement as to whether this enlargement is limited to early development or continues into adulthood. In this study, cortical gray and white tissue volumes were examined in a sample of adolescents and adults with autism who had demonstrated total brain enlargement in a previous magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} study.
Methods
An automated tissue segmentation program was applied to structural {MRI} scans to obtain volumes of gray, white, and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} tissue on a sample of adolescent and adult males ages 13-29 with autism (n = 23) and controls (n = 15). Regional differences for brain lobes and brain hemispheres were also examined.
Results
Significant enlargement in gray matter volume was found for the individuals with autism, with a disproportionate increase in left-sided gray matter volume. Lobe volume enlargements were detected for frontal and temporal, but not parietal or occipital lobes, in the subjects with autism. Age and nonverbal {IQ} effects on tissue volume were also observed.
Conclusions
These findings give evidence for left-lateralized gray tissue enlargement in adolescents and adults with autism, and demonstrate a regional pattern of cortical lobe volumes underlying this effect.},

	abstract = {{RATIONALE} {AND} {OBJECTIVES:} Manual segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance images is a challenging and time-consuming task. An automated system has been developed for brain tumor segmentation that will provide objective, reproducible segmentations that are close to the manual results. Additionally, the method segments white matter, grey matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and edema. The segmentation of pathology and healthy structures is crucial for surgical planning and intervention.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} The method performs the segmentation of a registered set of magnetic resonance images using an expectation-maximization scheme. The segmentation is guided by a spatial probabilistic atlas that contains expert prior knowledge about brain structures. This atlas is modified with the subject-specific brain tumor prior that is computed based on contrast enhancement.
{RESULTS:} Five cases with different types of tumors are selected for evaluation. The results obtained from the automatic segmentation program are compared with results from manual and semi-automated methods. The automated method yields results that have surface distances at roughly 1-4 mm compared with the manual results.
{CONCLUSION:} The automated method can be applied to different types of tumors. Although its performance is below that of the semi-automated method, it has the advantage of requiring no user supervision.},

	abstract = {A new method has been developed for fully automated segmentation of white matter lesions ({WMLs)} in cranial {MR} imaging. The algorithm uses information from {T1}-weighted ({T1}-w), inversion recovery ({IR)}, proton density-weighted ({PD)}, T2-weighted (T2-w) and fluid attenuation inversion recovery ({FLAIR)} scans. It is based on the K-Nearest Neighbor ({KNN)} classification technique that builds a feature space from voxel intensities and spatial information. The technique generates images representing the probability per voxel being part of a {WML.} By application of thresholds on these probability maps, binary segmentations can be obtained. {ROC} curves show that the segmentations achieve both high sensitivity and specificity. A similarity index ({SI)}, overlap fraction ({OF)} and extra fraction ({EF)} are calculated for additional quantitative analysis of the result. The {SI} is also used for determination of the optimal probability threshold for generation of the binary segmentation. Using probabilistic equivalents of the {SI}, {OF} and {EF}, the probability maps can be evaluated directly, providing a powerful tool for comparison of different classification results. This method for automated {WML} segmentation reaches an accuracy that is comparable to methods for multiple sclerosis ({MS)} lesion segmentation and is suitable for detection of {WMLs} in large and longitudinal population studies.},

We used a combination of automated and supervised segmentation methods to define regions of interest based on neuroanatomical knowledge. We also used {3D} surface rendering techniques to create a brain atlas that would allow us to visualize complex {3D} brain structures. We further linked this Information to script files in order to preserve both spatial information and neuroanatomical knowledge. We present here the application of the atlas for visualization in surgical planning far model-driven segmentation and for the teaching of neuroanatomy. This digitized human brain has the potential to provide important reference information for the planning of surgical procedures. It can also serve as a powerful teaching tool, since spatial relationships among neuroanatomical structures can be more readily envisioned when the user is able to view and rotate the structures in {3D} space. Moreover, each element of the brain atlas is associated with a name tag, displayed by a user controlled pointer. The atlas holds a major promise as a template for model-driven segmentation.

To overcome the inherent difficulties associated with this segmentation problem, we present a new method of information integration in a graph based framework. In addition to image intensity, tissue priors and local boundary information are integrated into the edge weight metrics in the graph. Furthermore, inhomogeneity correction is incorporated by adaptively adjusting the edge weights according to the intermediate inhomogeneity estimation. In the validation experiments of simulated brain {MRIs}, the proposed method outperformed a segmentation method based on iterated conditional modes ({ICM)}, which is a commonly used optimization method in medical image segmentation. In the experiments of real neonatal brain {MRIs}, the results of the proposed method have good overlap with the manual segmentations by human experts.},

Twenty state-of-the-art tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 65 multi-contrast {MR} scans of low- and high-grade glioma patients - manually annotated by up to four raters - and to 65 comparable scans generated using tumor simulation software. Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74-85\%), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all subregions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements.

Methods
This study reports speed, precision and estimated accuracy of our algorithm when measuring {MRIs} of meningioma brain tumors and compares it to manual tracing and modified {MacDonald} ({MM)} ellipsoid criteria. A repeated-measures study allowed us to determine measurement precisions ({MPs)} {\textendash} clinically relevant thresholds for statistically significant change.
Results
Speed: the level set, {MM}, and trace methods required 1:20, 1:35, and 9:35 (mm:ss) respectively on average to complete a volume measurement (p \&lt; 0.05). Accuracy: the level set was not statistically different to the estimated true lesion volumes (p \&gt; 0.05). Precision: the {MM's} within-operator and between-operator {MPs} were significantly higher (worse) than the other methods (p \&lt; 0.05). The observed difference in {MP} between the level set and trace methods did not reach statistical significance (p \&gt; 0.05).
Conclusion
Our level set is faster on average than {MM}, yet has accuracy and precision comparable to manual tracing.},

	abstract = {Brain extraction, also known as skull stripping, is one of the most important preprocessing steps for many automatic brain image analysis. In this paper we present a new approach called Multispectral Adaptive Region Growing Algorithm ({MARGA)} to perform the skull stripping process. {MARGA} is based on a region growing ({RG)} algorithm which uses the complementary information provided by conventional magnetic resonance images ({MRI)} such as {T1}-weighted and T2-weighted to perform the brain segmentation. {MARGA} can be seen as an extension of the skull stripping method proposed by Park and Lee (2009) [1], enabling their use in both axial views and low quality images. Following the same idea, we first obtain seed regions that are then spread using a {2D} {RG} algorithm which behaves differently in specific zones of the brain. This adaptation allows to deal with the fact that middle {MRI} slices have better image contrast between the brain and non-brain regions than superior and inferior brain slices where the contrast is smaller. {MARGA} is validated using three different databases: 10 simulated brains from the {BrainWeb} database; 2 data sets from the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing ({NAMIC)} database, the first one consisting in 10 normal brains and 10 brains of schizophrenic patients acquired with a 3 T {GE} scanner, and the second one consisting in 5 brains from lupus patients acquired with a 3 T Siemens scanner; and 10 brains of multiple sclerosis patients acquired with a 1.5 T scanner. We have qualitatively and quantitatively compared {MARGA} with the well-known Brain Extraction Tool ({BET)}, Brain Surface Extractor ({BSE)} and Statistical Parametric Mapping ({SPM)} approaches. The obtained results demonstrate the validity of {MARGA}, outperforming the results of those standard techniques.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional ({3D)} medical imaging has been incorporated in routine clinical practice, since the required infrastructure has become increasingly affordable. New algorithms and applications are needed to serve the additional image processing and analysis functions in {3D} space. In this work we propose a system for semi-automatic modeling and segmentation of elongated salient and anatomical objects in {3D} medical images. The proposed methodology is based on a novel mathematical formalization of a well-known class of geometric primitives, namely generalized cylinders ({GCs)}, which exhibits advantages over the existing parametric definition. Since the anatomical objects have to be modeled by their intersection with the transverse image planes, the proposed methodology includes also a new seeded region growing ({SRG)} segmentation algorithm for ellipse detection in {2D} images, based on a priori shape knowledge. Finally, the resulting {GC} model is used to initialize an active surface ({AS)} segmentation method, in order to accurately delineate the required object. In this work we present the proposed algorithms in detail, along with the evaluation of the accuracy of the model-based segmentation by experts. Results show that elongated objects like the aorta and the trachea may be segmented with sensitivity between 90\% and 95\%. The proposed {SRG-ellipse} detector requires minimal user-initialization and its executions requires only few seconds for each image slice on an average laptop. The evolution of the {AS} requires less than one second per iteration for a typical {CT} image. Comparisons are provided with state of the art semi-automatic medical image processing software, which validate the merit of the proposed work.},

The integrated analysis of the data requires robust tools for segmentation, registration and fiber tracking, which we combine in an automated manner. Our automated workflow is strongly desired due to the large number of subjects. Especially, we introduce the use of histogram segmentation to processed {fMRI} data to obtain functionally important seed and target regions for fiber tracking between them. This enables analysis of individually important resting state networks. We also discuss various approaches for the assessment of white matter integrity parameters along tracts, and in particular we introduce the use of functional data analysis ({FDA)} for this task.},

	abstract = {Fuzzy sets and rough sets have been widely used in many clustering algorithms for medical image segmentation, and have recently been combined together to better deal with the uncertainty implied in observed image data. Despite of their wide spread applications, traditional hybrid approaches are sensitive to the empirical weighting parameters and random initialization, and hence may produce less accurate results. In this paper, a novel hybrid clustering approach, namely the generalized rough fuzzy c-means ({GRFCM)} algorithm is proposed for brain {MR} image segmentation. In this algorithm, each cluster is characterized by three automatically determined rough-fuzzy regions, and accordingly the membership of each pixel is estimated with respect to the region it locates. The importance of each region is balanced by a weighting parameter, and the bias field in {MR} images is modeled by a linear combination of orthogonal polynomials. The weighting parameter estimation and bias field correction have been incorporated into the iterative clustering process. Our algorithm has been compared to the existing rough c-means and hybrid clustering algorithms in both synthetic and clinical brain {MR} images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more robust to the initialization, noise, and bias field, and can produce more accurate and reliable segmentations.},
